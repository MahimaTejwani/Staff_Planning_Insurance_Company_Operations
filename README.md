An **insurance company** seeks expertise in **optimizing their staffing levels** for their **insurance application approval process**. In this industry context, staffing is quantified as a **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE)** metric. For instance, a **full-time employee (FTE = 1)** working 50 hours a week equates to **0.2 FTEs** for every 10 hours worked. Correspondingly, if the full-time wage for 50 hours is **$5000**, a part-time employee (0.2 FTE) earns **$1000** (20% of $5000).

The company operates across three states: **A, B, and C**. They have two options for handling applications: utilizing **in-house staff** or **outsourcing** to external vendors. It is important to note that outsourcing does not have a **capacity limit**.

In-house staff, if employed full-time, can process **40 insurance applications per month**, assuming they work all available workdays. However, this capacity may be reduced due to **training, off days, or other non-working days**.

There are **regulatory constraints** in states A and B: outsourced applications must not exceed **30% and 40%** of the total application volume per month, respectively.

The primary goal is to **optimize the total cost** involved in the application approval process. This involves strategically allocating the right number of applications between **in-house FTEs** and **external vendors**, while simultaneously ensuring that the **monthly application demand** in each state is met.

This task requires a careful analysis of the balance between **in-house processing capabilities** and the potential for **outsourcing**, all within the **regulatory limits** of each state, to achieve **cost efficiency** in the application approval process.
